(* Tests that the Tglx1 library link flags are correct.

   Compile with:
   ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -package ctypes.foreign,tgls.tglx1 \
                    -o linkglx1.byte linkglx1.ml
   ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg -package ctypes.foreign,tgls.tglx1 \
                      -o linkglx1.native linkglx1.ml

   We try to load a symbol that should only be in the corresponding
   version.  We load directly with ctypes since Tgls functions fail on
   use and we cannot use since we don't have any context (and don't
   want to setup one as this may automatically link other things
   in). *)

open Tglx1
open Ctypes
open Foreign

let str = Printf.sprintf

let lookup symb =
  try
    ignore (foreign_value symb (ptr void));
    Printf.printf "[OK] Found %s for GLX 1.x\n" symb;
    exit 0
  with
  | Dl.DL_error _ ->
      Printf.eprintf "[FAIL] %s not found for GLX 1.x\n" symb;
      exit 1

let yes = ref true
let test () =
  let link () = if !yes then () else Glx.wait_x (); in
  link (); (* just make sure the library is linked *)
  lookup "glXWaitX"

let main () =
  let exec = Filename.basename Sys.executable_name in
